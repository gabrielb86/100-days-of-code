# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finally understood the logic behind the short program from the While Loop 3 (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts**: It took me a while to understand how this program works, but finally it clicked. The Python tutor and its visualization tool helped a lot. Probably would be a good idea to give a look to my notes about the program tomorrow morning. I also tried the alternative solution provided by another participant in the forum, and understood it as well.

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advanced to While Loop 4 quiz (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts**: I tried for a while to make sense of the quiz and solve it by myself, with no success. I check some forum's posts and read the solution, but still couldn't understand it, probably because it was late and I was tired. I coded for almost one hour. Earlier during the day I also started to listening the CodeNewbie podcast for the first time.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Understood the While Loop 4 quiz and three more exercises (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts**: I spend today quite a few hours (~ 3 or even more) trying to grasp the While Loop 4 quiz. Finally, I did it and also advanced through three more exercises. Tomorrow I plan to continue and watch the video corresponding to "12. Mad Libs: Take Two".

### Day 3: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed an additional quiz (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts**: Today I studied around 40 minutes, and completed the "Word in Position" quiz. I also heard the CodeNewbie podcast, to try to compensate the 20 minutes I could not study.

### Day 4: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made half of the HTML version of the videogames venture's website.

**Thoughts**: I attempted to advance with the Intro to Programming's course and felt a bit frustrated and clueless. I decided to take a break from Python and use the next few days to practice and learn Frontend coding. Michael also asked me to fix some sG's bugs.

### Day 5: January 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time fixing sG's bugs.

**Thoughts**: I found refreshing taking a break from Python to do some Frontend things again. I also heard the CodeNewbie podcast.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 6: January 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time fixing sG's bugs and resumed work on my personal website.

**Thoughts:** Besides what I already mentioned, I read some interesting articles on Smashing Magazine.

### Day 7: January 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Resumed Intro to Programming's course

**Thoughts:** Not too much progress, though.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 8: January 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried to tackle the "Code your own quiz" project without much success.

**Thoughts:** I read the advice from Antonella, and will try to follow: it's better to separate a big problem into smaller chunks, and try to approach those chunks one by one.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 9: January 06, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Created the "level_select" function for the Code your own quiz project.

**Thoughts:** Today I felt that I was able to understand the problem better, and do some real progress. I feel that I'm on the right way.

### Day 10 - 14: January 07 - 10, 2018

**Last days' Progress**: Advanced on the fill in the blanks quiz - Understood the difference between multiple if statements and elif (10.01.18).

**Thoughts:** These last days I've been working on the fill in the blanks quiz. I think I have a good enough approach to solve the problem, but I'm confused, because the program is not doing what I expect: it should stop after the third wrong guess instead of going back to the first question. I already asked for help on Stack Overflow and Reddit, and got a bit discouraged and angry because I think the one who answered was not helpful at all and a bit of a jerk. On a happier note, I already understand the difference between multiple "if" statemens and "elif" statements: if you use multiple "if" statements, all of them would be checked. That's not the case with the "elif" statements, which should be used in case of mutually exclusive conditions. Enough coding for today ;)

### Day 15: January 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got input from Reddit and Antonella about the fill-in-the-blanks quiz. Decided to start blogging.

**Thoughts:** A couple of people were helpful and gave me advice about how to solve my issue with the fill-in-the-blanks quiz returning to the first question after the second question was answered wrong, but I didn't took the time to check into the code. Instead, I tried to do some progress on my personal website and learn a bit more about CSS Grid. While doing that, I thought that it's going to be a good idea to start blogging as a way of solidifying my knowledge.

### Day 16: January 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I got a working version of the fill-in-the-blanks quiz.

**Thoughts**: I think I got a better understanding of how while loops work. Although the program works, I still need to refactor it. I'll do that using the suggestions that Antonella gave me.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 17: January 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started refactoring the fill-in-the-blanks quiz and reduced three (repeated) functions to one.

**Thoughts**: Doing the refactoring was easier than I thought. I also deleted the recursive call that the Reddit user suggested me to remove: it is not needed because of the way how while loops work (I suppose I'll understand this more clearly in the future).

### Day 18: January 28, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Sent the "Code your quiz" project

**Thoughts**: Took a few days off because of sickness. Finally sent the "Code your quiz" project and kept advancing with Udacity's lessons.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 19: January 29, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started implementing the corrections for the "Code your quiz" project

**Thoughts**: Received good commentaries and corrections to improve the "Code your quiz" project. I'm trying to learn from these corrections.

**Link to work**: None

### Day 20: January 30, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Still working on Code your quiz project

**Thoughts**: -

### Day 21: February 04, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made the program to work according to the suggestions made by the reviewer.
**Thoughts**: Found a way to make the program to work. I send it again for revision and will wait for the answer / new suggestions. Compared to the previous version, it is way shorter and looks pretty good I'd say.
**Link to work**: None

### Day 22: February 05, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Implemented the two corrections made by the Udacity reviewer, learn a bit about magic numbers
**Thoughts**: The changes were easier to implement than what I initially thought. I'm finally grasping the magic number thing, but still asked a question to the reviewer about it.
