# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finally understood the logic behind the short program from the While Loop 3 (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to understand how this program works, but finally it clicked. The Python tutor and its visualization tool helped a lot. Probably would be a good idea to give a look to my notes about the program tomorrow morning.
