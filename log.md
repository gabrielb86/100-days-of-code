# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: December 28, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I finally understood the logic behind the short program from the While Loop 3 (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts:** It took me a while to understand how this program works, but finally it clicked. The Python tutor and its visualization tool helped a lot. Probably would be a good idea to give a look to my notes about the program tomorrow morning. I also tried the alternative solution provided by another participant in the forum, and understood it as well.

### Day 1: December 29, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Advanced to While Loop 4 quiz (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts:** I tried for a while to make sense of the quiz and solve it by myself, with no success. I check some forum's posts and read the solution, but still couldn't understand it, probably because it was late and I was tired. I coded for almost one hour. Earlier during the day I also started to listening the CodeNewbie podcast for the first time.

### Day 2: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Understood the While Loop 4 quiz and three more exercises (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts:** I spend today quite a few hours (~ 3 or even more) trying to grasp the While Loop 4 quiz. Finally, I did it and also advanced through three more exercises. Tomorrow I plan to continue and watch the video corresponding to "12. Mad Libs: Take Two".

### Day 3: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Completed an additional quiz (Lesson 13 - Udacity course).

**Thoughts:** Today I studied around 40 minutes, and completed the "Word in Position" quiz. I also heard the CodeNewbie podcast, to try to compensate the 20 minutes I could not study.

### Day 4: January 01, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made half of the HTML version of the videogames venture's website.

**Thoughts:** I attempted to advance with the Intro to Programming's course and felt a bit frustrated and clueless. I decided to take a break from Python and use the next few days to practice and learn Frontend coding. Michael also asked me to fix some sG's bugs.

### Day 5: January 02, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time fixing sG's bugs.

**Thoughts:** I found refreshing taking a break from Python to do some Frontend things again. I also heard the CodeNewbie podcast.

### Day 6: January 03, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Spent the time fixing sG's bugs and resumed work on my personal website.

**Thoughts:** Besides what I already mentioned, I read some interesting articles on Smashing Magazine.
